Code Overview: Visualizing Energy Efficiency in Code Implementations
This script is part of a larger research project focused on energy efficiency in software development. The goal of this specific visualization is to compare the computational cost (in USD) of different code implementations, highlighting the energy and cost impact of software choices.

Explanation:
Purpose: The bar chart compares the cost associated with running different types of code, including "Efficient Code," "Inefficient Code," "Python Code," and "Java Code." These costs are derived from energy consumption calculations and their financial implications.
Logarithmic Scale: Since the costs span several orders of magnitude, a logarithmic scale is used for the y-axis to provide a clear and meaningful comparison.
Data: The costs (in USD) represent computational expenses, likely tied to power usage or execution time across different programming languages and styles of implementation.
Colors: Each bar is color-coded for easier differentiation between the code methods.
Research Context:
This visualization contributes to understanding how coding practices and language selection affect energy consumption and financial costs. It emphasizes the importance of writing efficient code not only for better performance but also for reducing energy consumption and its environmental and financial impact.

How It Fits in the Project:
The research investigates the interplay between software design and sustainability. By quantifying and visualizing the costs of different implementations, it encourages developers to prioritize energy-efficient coding practices, fostering environmentally friendly software development.
